      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Students often struggle to know how much time they actually study. Estimations are rarely accurate, and without precise tracking, it's impossible to optimize your study habits or meet academic goals. Whether you're preparing for exams or working on long-term projects, accurate time tracking is essential.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Track Study Time?</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing exact study hours helps improve time management and productivity. It reveals patterns in your learning habits, shows which subjects need more attention, and helps you plan realistic study schedules. Plus, seeing your progress in concrete numbers can be incredibly motivating.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">duration calculator</Link> to log how long you studied each day. Simply enter your start and finish times, and you'll get precise measurements in hours and minutes. No more guessing or rough estimates.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Example Study Session</h3>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <div><strong>Start:</strong> 2:10 PM</div>
          <div><strong>End:</strong> 5:05 PM</div>
          <div className="pt-2 border-t border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
            <strong>➡ Total Study Time = 2 hours 55 minutes</strong>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Study Tracking Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Track 25-minute focused sessions with breaks</li>
        <li><strong>Subject rotation:</strong> Log time spent on each subject separately</li>
        <li><strong>Deep work blocks:</strong> Measure longer, uninterrupted study periods</li>
        <li><strong>Review sessions:</strong> Track time spent reviewing vs. learning new material</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analyzing Your Study Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">hours calculator</Link> to identify when you're most productive. Are you more focused in the morning or evening? How long can you maintain concentration? This data helps you schedule study time when you're naturally most alert and effective.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting Realistic Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate time tracking helps you set achievable study goals. Instead of vague plans like "study more," you can set specific targets like "study math for 90 minutes daily." Our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link> helps you measure progress toward these concrete goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Boost your academic performance by tracking study sessions precisely with ClockMath. Understanding exactly how much time you invest in learning helps you study smarter, not just harder. Start measuring your study time today and watch your productivity improve.
