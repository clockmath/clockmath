      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Timesheets are the bridge between work performed and wages paid. Getting them right matters—errors mean employees are either underpaid or overpaid, and neither situation is acceptable. Yet many people still struggle with converting clock times to total hours, especially when dealing with varying schedules.
      </p>

      <h2>The Manual Calculation Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Converting each day's start and end times to hours worked seems simple until you try it. Subtract 8:45 AM from 5:15 PM, remember to remove the lunch break, convert minutes to decimals—the process is tedious and error-prone. Multiply this across five or more days and multiple employees, and mistakes become inevitable.
      </p>

      <h2>Calculate Each Day Quickly</h2>
      <p>
        Our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link> eliminates the manual math. For each day on your timesheet, enter the start time and end time to instantly see the hours worked. The calculator handles all the conversion automatically and provides results in both standard (hours:minutes) and decimal formats.

      <h2>Decimal Hours for Payroll</h2>
      <p>
        Most payroll systems require time in decimal format. Instead of 8 hours and 30 minutes, they need 8.5 hours. Our calculator automatically converts your time to decimals, making it easy to enter accurate figures into any payroll system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common conversions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>15 minutes = 0.25 hours</li>
        <li>30 minutes = 0.5 hours</li>
        <li>45 minutes = 0.75 hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Handling Breaks and Deductions</h2>
      <p>
        Timesheets must account for unpaid breaks. Whether you clock out for lunch or have an automatic deduction, the final hours should reflect actual paid work time. Our calculator lets you subtract break time to get the true billable or payable hours.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits for Employers and Employees</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For employees:</strong> Verify your hours are calculated correctly before submitting</li>
        <li><strong>For managers:</strong> Quickly validate timesheet submissions</li>
        <li><strong>For payroll:</strong> Get decimal-ready figures without manual conversion</li>
        <li><strong>For compliance:</strong> Maintain accurate records for labor law requirements</li>
      </ul>
