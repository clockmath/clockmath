      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As a freelancer, consultant, or independent contractor, your income depends on accurately tracking and billing your time. Whether you charge by the hour or use time tracking to estimate project costs, knowing exactly how long tasks take is essential for running a profitable business.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem with Guessing</h2>
      <p>
        Many freelancers underestimate the time they spend on projects. That quick email response, the brief revision, the unexpected client call—these small tasks add up. Without accurate tracking, you end up working more hours than you bill, effectively reducing your hourly rate. Studies suggest freelancers lose 10-20% of billable time to tasks they forget to track.
      </p>

      <h2>Calculate Time Per Task</h2>
      <p>
        Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link> to quickly determine how long you spent on any task. Enter the start time when you begin and the end time when you finish, then record that duration against the client or project. This simple habit transforms vague time estimates into accurate billing.

      <div className="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Billable Hours Example</h3>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <div><strong>Task:</strong> Website design review</div>
          <div><strong>Start:</strong> 2:15 PM</div>
          <div><strong>End:</strong> 4:45 PM</div>
          <div className="pt-2 border-t border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
            <strong>➡ Billable Time = 2 hours 30 minutes (2.5 hours)</strong>
          </div>
          <div className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
            At $75/hour = $187.50
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Billable vs. Non-Billable Time</h2>
      <p>
        Not all work time is billable. Administrative tasks, marketing, invoicing, and professional development are necessary but typically aren't charged to clients. Tracking both types helps you understand your true effective hourly rate and identify where your time actually goes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Billable:</strong> Client work, meetings, revisions, research for projects</li>
        <li><strong>Non-billable:</strong> Invoicing, marketing, emails, learning new skills</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Converting Time to Invoices</h2>
      <p>
        Most invoicing requires decimal hours rather than hours and minutes. Our calculator provides both formats. For example, 2 hours and 15 minutes equals 2.25 hours—multiply by your rate and you have your invoice amount.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Better Time Tracking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Track in real-time:</strong> Record times as you work, not from memory at day's end</li>
        <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Note what task you completed for each time entry</li>
        <li><strong>Include everything:</strong> Emails, calls, and small revisions count too</li>
        <li><strong>Round consistently:</strong> Decide on a rounding policy (e.g., to nearest 15 minutes) and apply it fairly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate time tracking is the foundation of a sustainable freelance business.
